# Overview

AI Ethical Scanner is an open-source tool designed to detect potential biases in datasets used for training machine learning models. The project aims to make AI fairer, more transparent, and inclusive by providing an analysis pipeline that highlights disparities in sensitive variables such as gender, ethnicity, and age.

# Why this project?

The adoption of AI systems is growing every day, but often models reflect the inequalities present in the data they are trained on. This project aims to provide an accessible tool to:

- Identify biases in datasets before training.
- Assess the fairness of models.
- Support the development of more responsible AI.

# Features

- Automated exploratory analysis on sensitive variables

- Fairness metrics (e.g., Disparate Impact, Equal Opportunity Difference)

- Interactive visualizations

- Final report with summary results and recommendations

- Modular and customizable pipeline

# How it works

1. Upload the dataset (CSV, JSON, or tabular format)

2. Select the sensitive variables (e.g., gender, race, age)

3. The system generates a report with:

- Distribution of variables
- Disparity metrics
- Fairness thresholds
- Automatic visualizations

Final output with recommendations on how to mitigate biases
